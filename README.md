## **Customer Segmentation using Clustering**

### **Overview**
This notebook performs **customer segmentation** using clustering techniques. The goal is to group customers based on their profile and transaction behavior to derive actionable business insights. The dataset includes:
- **Customers.csv**: Customer profile information.
- **Transactions.csv**: Transaction details.
- **Products.csv**: Product information.

The notebook follows these steps:
1. **Data Preparation**: Load and merge datasets.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create customer profiles using transaction and product data.
3. **Clustering**: Use K-Means clustering to segment customers.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate clustering using metrics like the Davies-Bouldin Index and Silhouette Score.
5. **Visualization**: Visualize clusters using PCA and interactive plots.
6. **Business Insights**: Derive insights from the clusters.

### **Steps Performed**

#### **1. Data Preparation**
- Loaded `Customers.csv`, `Transactions.csv`, and `Products.csv`.
- Merged the datasets on `CustomerID` and `ProductID` to create a unified dataset.

#### **2. Feature Engineering**
- Created customer profiles by aggregating transaction data:
  - **Total Spending**: Sum of `TotalValue` for each customer.
  - **Total Quantity Purchased**: Sum of `Quantity` for each customer.
  - **Average Product Price**: Mean of `Price` for each customer.
  - **Most Purchased Category**: Mode of `Category` for each customer.
  - **Customer Tenure**: Calculated as the number of days since the customer signed up.
- One-hot encoded categorical features (`Region` and `Category`).
- Normalized numerical features using `StandardScaler`.

#### **3. Clustering**
- Used **K-Means clustering** to segment customers into groups.
- Determined the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method** or **Silhouette Score**.

#### **4. Evaluation**
- Evaluated clustering using:
  - **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Measures the quality of clustering (lower is better).
  - **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar a customer is to their own cluster compared to other clusters (higher is better).

#### **5. Visualization**
- Reduced dimensionality using **PCA** to visualize clusters in 2D space.
- Created static plots using **Matplotlib** and interactive plots using **Plotly**.

#### **6. Business Insights**
- Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster to derive actionable insights:
  - **High-Spending Customers**: Identify customers with high total spending.
  - **Frequent Buyers**: Identify customers who purchase frequently.
  - **Loyal Customers**: Identify customers with long tenure.
  - **Category Preferences**: Identify customers with a preference for specific product categories.

### **Key Insights**

#### **1. Total Spending by Region**
- **Insight**: Identify which region contributes the most to total sales.
- **Visualization**: Bar chart showing total spending by region.

#### **2. Average Transaction Value by Region**
- **Insight**: Compare the average transaction value across regions.
- **Visualization**: Bar chart showing average transaction value by region.

#### **3. Most Purchased Product Categories**
- **Insight**: Identify the most popular product categories.
- **Visualization**: Bar chart showing the number of purchases per category.

#### **4. Customer Tenure Distribution**
- **Insight**: Analyze how long customers have been with the company.
- **Visualization**: Histogram showing the distribution of customer tenure.

#### **5. Total Spending vs. Quantity Purchased**
- **Insight**: Explore the relationship between total spending and quantity purchased.
- **Visualization**: Scatter plot showing total spending vs. quantity purchased.

#### **6. Cluster Characteristics**
- **Insight**: Analyze the characteristics of each cluster (e.g., high spenders, frequent buyers, loyal customers).
- **Visualization**: PCA plot showing customer clusters.
